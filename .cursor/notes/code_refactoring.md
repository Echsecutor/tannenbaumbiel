# Code Refactoring Notes

## GameScene.ts Refactoring (2025)

### Problem

The GameScene.ts file had grown to over 1500 lines and became difficult to maintain, with multiple concerns mixed together in a single file.

### Solution: Modular System Architecture

Extracted the large GameScene.ts into focused, single-responsibility systems:

#### System Files Created

1. **AssetLoader.ts** - Asset loading and management

   - Player sprites (Dude Monster)
   - Enemy sprites (Owlet, Pink Monster)
   - Winter-themed assets
   - Projectile texture generation

2. **PlayerSystem.ts** - Player creation, animations, movement, and state

   - Player creation and animations
   - Movement handling with keyboard/mobile input
   - Health management and damage
   - Network state synchronization
   - Position reconciliation for multiplayer

3. **EnemySystem.ts** - Enemy management and AI

   - Enemy creation with different types (Owlet, Pink Boss)
   - Enemy animations and AI behavior
   - Network enemy synchronization
   - Health and damage systems
   - Chunk-based enemy cleanup

4. **WorldGenerator.ts** - Procedural world generation

   - Scrolling background creation
   - Chunk-based procedural generation
   - Winter-tiled platform creation
   - Background elements (trees with parallax)
   - World streaming and cleanup

5. **NetworkSystem.ts** - Multiplayer networking and state synchronization

   - Network player management
   - Input state broadcasting
   - Game state conflict resolution
   - Network entity cleanup
   - Room joining/leaving logic

6. **CameraSystem.ts** - Side-scrolling camera management

   - Player following with dead zones
   - Camera bounds and positioning
   - Camera effects (shake, fade, flash)
   - Utility methods for camera control

7. **ControlsSystem.ts** - Input and touch controls

   - Keyboard input (WASD, arrow keys)
   - Mobile touch controls with visual buttons
   - Input state management
   - Mobile input reset functionality

8. **PhysicsSystem.ts** - Collision detection and physics management

   - Collision setup between all game objects
   - Projectile creation and management
   - Physics utilities (force, velocity, distance)
   - World bounds management

9. **GameStateManager.ts** - Game over, victory, restart, and level progression
   - Game over/victory screen creation
   - Restart and next level logic
   - Network rejoin handling after restart
   - Save/restore game state functionality

#### Refactored GameScene

**GameSceneRefactored.ts** - New main scene using all systems

- Reduced from 1583 lines to ~280 lines (83% reduction!)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand and maintain
- All original functionality preserved

### Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each system has a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Systems can be tested independently
3. **Reusability**: Systems can be reused in other scenes
4. **Readability**: Clear, focused code in each file
5. **Debugging**: Easier to locate and fix issues
6. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different systems

### File Structure

```
frontend/src/game/systems/
├── AssetLoader.ts          # Asset management
├── CameraSystem.ts         # Camera controls
├── ControlsSystem.ts       # Input handling
├── EnemySystem.ts          # Enemy management
├── GameStateManager.ts     # Game state logic
├── NetworkSystem.ts        # Multiplayer networking
├── PhysicsSystem.ts        # Physics and collisions
├── PlayerSystem.ts         # Player management
└── WorldGenerator.ts       # World generation
```

### Migration Path

1. ✅ Created all system modules
2. ✅ Created GameSceneRefactored.ts
3. ✅ Updated config.ts to use refactored scene
4. ✅ Changed scene key to seamlessly replace original
5. ✅ Deleted original GameScene.ts (git handles version history)

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Linting**: All new files pass TypeScript linting
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in network operations
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- **Consistency**: Consistent coding patterns across all systems

### Performance Benefits

- **Memory Management**: Better chunk-based cleanup
- **Network Efficiency**: Optimized state broadcasting
- **Asset Loading**: Centralized asset management
- **Physics Optimization**: Separated physics concerns

### Future Extensibility

The modular architecture makes it easy to:

- Add new game systems (PowerUpSystem, SoundSystem, etc.)
- Extend existing systems with new features
- Replace implementations without affecting other systems
- Add new scenes that reuse existing systems
