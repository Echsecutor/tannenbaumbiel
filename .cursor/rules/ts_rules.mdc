# Consider Phaser API

Before working with any Phaser objects, do a quick lookup on https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/api-documentation and links therein for the right syntax.

Always check for phaser build in methods and prefer using these over re-writing functionality. In particular for game physics, start/stop of game loops, etc.

# Verify Build After Code Changes

**MANDATORY**: After making any code changes, always run the build process to ensure compilation success:

```bash
# Frontend Build Check
cd frontend && npm run build

```
